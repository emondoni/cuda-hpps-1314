# Optimization of a MATLAB Iterative Kernel: Performance Comparisons Between GPU-based Computing and the Polyhedral Model
Research Project for the High Performance Processors and Systems course @ PoliMi, a.y. 2013/14, by Edoardo Mondoni

This is the repository for the above project. The <code>hpps-c</code> and <code>hpps-cuda</code> folders contain code for the polyhedral version and the CUDA version, respectively. The <code>Deliveries</code> folder contains a detailed project report and the slide deck that was used for the presentation of the project at Politecnico di Milano.
